## Advanced Settings

Here are some advanced options to customize your grid a little more


### Custom columns

Gridle will generate for you all the columns you need, depending on the context setting. That's fine. But sometimes, you need some special columns... For example, a column of 33.333%, or 66.6667%, etc... This setting is made for you.

```fn
@include gridle_register_column( {name} , {column-count} , {context} );
```

```scss
/**
 * Here we register a column with the ratio 1/3
 * where the "1" is the column-count, and the "3" is the context
 * in which the column width will be calculated
 */
@include gridle_register_column( 1on3 , 1, 3 );

// another fancy example :
@include gridle_register_column( myFancyColumn , 12, 33 ); // 36.36%
```


### States classes

This option allows you to generate all the classes scoped in a .state-{state} class. This allows you to view your grid by applying the name of your state as a class on an html tag without needing media queries. This is more a debug option than a real production one...

```scss
@include gridle_setup( (
	context : 12,
	// etx...
	states-classes : true // activate the behavior
) );
```

Then :

```markup
<html class="state-mobile">
	<!-- this will activate the mobile state -->
```


### Generate JSON settings (for gridle.js)

This option allows you to enable / disable the generation of JSON settings in the CSS. This JSON is needed if you want to use gridle.js

```scss
$gridle-generate-json-settings : false; // default is true
```


### Classes prefix

This option allows you to specify a prefix that will be added to all the gridle generated classes.

```scss
@gridle_setup( (
	// your settings...
	classes-prefix : 'hello-'
) );
```

```markup
<div class="hello-row">
	<div class="hello-gr-2 hello-push-5 hello-hide@mobile">
		... All the classes will be affected ...
	</div>
</div>
```


### Classes names

These options are quite advanced but can be useful if you want to customize the generated class names exactly as you want.
Each pattern defines how the classname will be generated. These are the tokens that you can use in the patterns :

```fn
%state		: Represent the state name (mobile, coco, etc...)
%column		: Represent the column index (1, 2, 10, etc...)  
%reverse 	: Represent the "reverse" keyword in some patterns
%align 		: Represent the alignement like "center", "middle", etc...
%float 		: Represent the float like "left", "right" and "both"
%count 		: Used in some patterns to represent a number
%side 		: Reprensent a side for gutters like "top", "bottom", "left" and "right"
%column-count 	: Represent the column number in the order class

```

To see the default patterns, I let you check the **_settings.scss** file **in the gridle folder**

If you want to customize a pattern, you just have to use the gridle_set_classname_map mixin like so :

```fn
@include gridle_set_classname_map ( {package}, {pattern} );
```

Some generated css uses a generic classname like [class*="gr-"] to target some elements. By default the framework will try to generate this class by itself but you can tell the selector explicitly to use it like this

```fn
@include gridle_set_generic_selector( {package} , {selector} );
```

```scss
@include gridle_set_generic_selector(grid, '[class*="grid-"]');
```

> Note that the **{package}** parameter is the index of each map elements in the _settings.scss file like "clear-each", "grid", etc...


### Extend base classes

You can extend the base gridle classes by using the mixin bellow. This has to be used with caution only if you know what you are doing...

```fn
@include gridle_extend_base_class( {packages} , {css_map} , {states} );
```

```scss
// add some css to the grid classes
@include gridle_extend_base_class(grid, (
	content : "I will be applied on all the grid classes in all the states"
));

// add some css only to the mobile state, grid and push classes
@include gridle_extend_base_class(grid push, (
	content : "I will be applied on all the grid and push classes of mobile state"
), mobile);
```


### Apply css for all classes in some states

This mixin seems to be the same as the gridle_extend_base_class one. **The big difference is that by using this, you tell it to apply some css for all the specified package and all the states when the active state is the specified one.**

```fn
@include gridle_apply_css_for( {packages} , {css_map} , {states} );
```

```scss
// apply this css when the active state is mobile on all the grids
@include gridle_apply_css_for(grid grid-grow grid-adapt, (
	content : "I will be applied on all the grids when the active state is mobile"
), mobile);
```

> You can use this if you really need that particular behavior. Otherwise, it's more efficient to use something like this :

```scss
[class*="gr-"] {
	@include gridle_state(mobile) {
		content : "do something...";
	}
}
```
